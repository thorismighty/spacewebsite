                <h3><strong>Vostok</strong></h3>
                    <p>The Vostok program was a Soviet space program project that ran from 1960 to 1963 and achieved many spectacular milestones in spaceflight, including placing the first man in space, the first woman in space, and the first joint flight of two different crewed orbiters.</p>

            <div id="section">
                <h3><strong>Voskhod</strong></h3>
                    <p>The Voskhod spacecraft was a vehicle used by the Soviet Union during the Cold War space race to carry crews of up to three cosmonauts. Though it only flew two missions, Voskhod (which means "sunrise" in Russian) achieved major milestones with each flight: Bringing the first multi-person crew into space and helping carry out the first spacewalk in history. The USSR's Voskhod program ran from 1960 to 1963.</p>

            <div id="section">
                <h3><strong>Soyuz</strong></h3>
                    <p>The Soyuz programme is the longest operational human spacecraft programme in the history of space exploration. The first crewed flight into space was on 23 April 1967. Although they were conceived by the Soviet Union at the start of the sixties, the Soyuz spacecraft are still used today, but with important modifications. They have transported Russian crews to the Soviet stations Salyut, Mir, and the International Space Station.</p>

                <h3><strong>Buran</strong></h3>
                    <p>Buran, Soviet orbiter similar in design and function to the U.S. space shuttle. Designed by the Energia aerospace bureau, it made a single unmanned, fully automated flight in 1988, only to be grounded shortly thereafter due to cost overruns and the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
